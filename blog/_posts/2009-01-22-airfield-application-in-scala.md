Last summer I went to a [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) [course](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/pohjalai/ke08/scala/) at my University. There was this exercise to implement a [travelling-salesman-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) application with all the airfields of Finland. The idea was to input a list of airfields to the program as a file and then count the shortest route between those airfields without visiting the same airfield twice in a row.

I just decided to open-source it under [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php). The project is hosted at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/airfield/) and the direct download link is [here](http://airfield.googlecode.com/files/airfield-1.0.jar).

As a learning experience it was my first step into [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and trying to create an example of a nice and clean open-source project. Feel free to comment and make suggestions how to make it more functional. As said it was my first case with functional and being used to [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) it was difficult to see situations where functional would be more effective. I'd be extremely glad to hear your comments!

Documentation and usage instructions are in the project's [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/airfield/w/list).
