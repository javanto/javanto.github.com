My blog formerly known as [Ham and Eggs](http://hamandeggs.wordpress.com/) is now *the* blog for my company [Javanto](http://javanto.com). On the same move I took it off from Wordpress and deployed it on [GitHub pages](http://github.com/pages) which I happen to use for hosting my company's site.

With GitHub pages you can use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for generating static pages from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) templates. The dynamism of a blog comes the by doing git pushes to the project. With Jekyll you can use [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) for doing some trivial representation logic. And for syntax highlighting there are [Pygments](http://pygments.org/). The problem still is commenting, but it should be solved by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).

That's basically my stack from the blogging side. Also I transferred most of the writings and comments from the old blog to this new one.

Welcome and enjoy!
